# tic-tac-toe-TOP-project
This project really turned my brain inside out. I've learned a bit about modular JS, but I'll try my best! Understand the logic of the game. AI I borrowed in this article, thanks to the author. I tried very hard to understand the code, but it turned out so-so. I still have a lot to learn!
There are two game modes, two players, and player versus computer.
You can also play on your phone.

Unfortunately (or fortunately) I took the invincible AI algorithm. I wonder if anyone can win :)<br>
